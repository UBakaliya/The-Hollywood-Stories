       I was at a restaurant in NYC with friends and one spotted and recognized Hillary Swank nearby. She’d just made Boys Don’t Cry, but I hadn’t seen it and didn’t know her. I told my friend to go say hi if she was such a big deal and when he refuted that if it’s so easy I should do it and he’d pay my end of the bill.  So, I got up and went over, politely begged her pardon, and said I’d loved her in Boys Don’t Cry and Armageddon, and that she was lovely in those and looked lovely today too. I asked if she’d let me buy her a drink and she refused, offering to buy me a drink instead. I got to sit with her for ten minutes and chat. Wonderful woman, so down to earth.
