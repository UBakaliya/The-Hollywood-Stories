       Brad Pitt and George Clooney have been waging a prank war for years. It’s said that everything began when Clooney teased Pitt with an embarrassing note. Well, Brad Pitt decided to take revenge during the making of Ocean’s Twelve by sending out a memo to the crew saying, “Please don’t look Mr. Clooney in the eye and he also insists on being referred to as ’Mr. Ocean.’ ”
