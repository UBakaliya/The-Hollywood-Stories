        I was walking my dog, Queenie when I heard someone ask if I liked the neighborhood. I looked around and didn’t see anyone, so I looked up and saw Val Kilmer standing on the second-floor balcony of the house next to my building. I did the opposite of playing it cool and slid my sunglasses down my nose as my mouth fell open and said “Oh my God.” He flirted for a minute while my dog barked incessantly at him, and then I went to work and talked about my Val Kilmer encounter for the next two weeks.
